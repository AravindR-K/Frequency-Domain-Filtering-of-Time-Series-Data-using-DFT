# Frequency-Domain-Filtering-of-Time-Series-Data-using-DFT
A C-based project that performs frequency domain filtering of time-series data using DFT. It supports user-defined low-pass or high-pass filters to isolate desired frequency ranges. Results are visualized using Gnuplot for comparison between original and filtered signals.
